We talk about 3 Vs: Volume, Velocity, and Variety. Volume is the sheer amount of data. Velocity is how fast it comes in, and Variety means it comes in many different forms. The problem is Volume and Variety are huge hurdles for standard data mining.\n\n[SLIDE DESCRIPTION]\nThe slide contrasts Big Data and Data Mining: Big Data focuses on infrastructure and handling sheer size, while Data Mining focuses on finding patterns and insights within data.\n\n[TRANSCRIPT - 01:01:45]\nBig Data is mainly an infrastructure problem—how do you even store and process terabytes of data? Data Mining is an analysis problem—what can we actually extract from this mass of data? Don't confuse the two.\n", "document_id": "doc_083db815"}
