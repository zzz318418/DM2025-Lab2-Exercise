time, but simultaneously, it has an \neminently memorable and powerful message. Standing out from \nother crime movies, its ingenious concept keeps us on the edge \nof our seat throughout the whole film, and has us stunned after \nwhat may just be one of the most sensational endings in the \nhistory of cinema.  \nSe7en follows two detectives, Somerset(Morgan Freeman) and \nMills(Brad Pitt) on their hunt for a deranged serial killer. The \nreoccurring murders follow a pattern and an idea - they are \ncommitted according to the 7 deadly sins: Sloth, Gluttony, \nGreed, Lust, Envy, Pride and Wrath. This already denotes that \nthe killer wishes to send a message through these acts, they have \na meaning and a purpose. Throughout the film, we observe how \ncalculated and hauntingly intelligent the murderer truly is, as his \nidentity remains anonymous to the other characters as well as \nthe audience until the very end.  \nThe concept of the film is very interesting, as it has the audience wondering which sin the killer will pick next, \nand how he will represent it. The movie also has us questioning our own morals and principles, which makes the \nplot feel more real, as it raises real questions and feelings. This is haunting because Se7en is an extremely dark \ncinematic piece, which therefore means that on a certain level, this dark view matches our own reality. The cast is \nextraordinary as well, especially Kevin Spacey who plays the killer(whose name is purposely not included in the \nopening credits), despite his very short appearance, he still manages to make an impact, and he is perhaps the \nbest choice I could think of for the role. \nCinematographically, Se7en is quite amazing. Its aesthetic ties in with Fincher’s other films, as the gloomy and \nbleak atmosphere usually conveys is definitely present here. The plot takes place in an unnamed city which I find \nquite interesting because that means it could be anywhere. The haunting darkness remains throughout the whole \nentire film - except the ending, which is the only brightly lit scene in the whole movie. This jarring choice \ncompletely juxtaposes what actually happens in the ending. \nThere is no right way to describe the ending of this film in words, as one must see it themselves to truly \nunderstand, but it revolves around the killer finding a way to strongly prove his twisted point and leave an ever-\nlasting mark. The perception of the characters and the ideas of the film that the audience forms while watching is \ncompletely turned upside down. It is very poignant, while being extremely clever at the same time. It does not \neven feel like an ending, because the idea of it remains alive long after watching it. \nTo conclude, Se7en is an outstanding film from many points of view, including plot, cast and cinematography. It \nhas the audience completely captivated and questioning their own morals and thoughts, which is what I believe a \ngood and memorable movie should do - get inside the mind of the audience, captivate them throughout the \nmovie, keep them on the edge of their seat, but also leave them with something to think about after \nwatching it.\n\"\"\"\n\n", "document_id": "doc_ce871d0a"}
