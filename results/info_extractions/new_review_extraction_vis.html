Se7en 
-Movie Review- 
5/5 
David Fincher’s “Se7en” is <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">one of the most sinisterly dismal and 
disturbing films of all time</span>, but simultaneously, it has an 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">eminently memorable and powerful message</span>. Standing out from 
other crime movies, its <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">ingenious concept</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">keeps us on the edge 
of our seat throughout the whole film</span>, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">has us stunned after 
what may just be one of the most sensational endings in the 
history of cinema</span>.  
Se7en follows two detectives, Somerset(Morgan Freeman) and 
Mills(Brad Pitt) on their hunt for a deranged serial killer. The 
reoccurring murders follow a pattern and an idea - they are 
committed according to the 7 deadly sins: Sloth, Gluttony, 
Greed, Lust, Envy, Pride and Wrath. This already denotes that 
the killer wishes to send a message through these acts, they have 
a meaning and a purpose. Throughout the film, we observe how 
calculated and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">hauntingly intelligent the murderer truly is</span>, as his 
identity remains anonymous to the other characters as well as 
the audience until the very end.  
The concept of the film is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">very interesting</span>, as it <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">has the audience wondering which sin the killer will pick next, 
and how he will represent it</span>. The movie also <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">has us questioning our own morals and principles</span>, which makes the 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">plot feel more real</span>, as it raises real questions and feelings. This is haunting because Se7en is an extremely dark 
cinematic piece, which therefore means that on a certain level, this dark view matches our own reality. The cast is 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">extraordinary</span> as well, especially Kevin Spacey who plays the killer(whose name is purposely not included in the 
opening credits), despite his very short appearance, he still manages to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">make an impact</span>, and he is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">perhaps the 
best choice I could think of for the role</span>. 
Cinematographically, Se7en is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">quite amazing</span>. Its aesthetic ties in with Fincher’s other films, as the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">gloomy and 
bleak atmosphere usually conveys is definitely present here</span>. The plot takes place in an unnamed city which I find 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">quite interesting</span> because that means it could be anywhere. The <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">haunting darkness remains throughout the whole 
entire film</span> - except the ending, which is the only brightly lit scene in the whole movie. This <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">jarring choice</span> 
completely juxtaposes what actually happens in the ending. 
There is no right way to describe the ending of this film in words, as one must see it themselves to truly 
understand, but it <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">revolves around the killer finding a way to strongly prove his twisted point and leave an</span> ever-
lasting mark. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">The perception of the characters and the ideas of the film that the audience forms while watching is 
completely turned upside down</span>. It is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">very poignant</span>, while being <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">extremely clever</span> at the same time. It <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">does not 
even feel like an ending, because the idea of it remains alive long after watching it</span>. 
To conclude, Se7en is an <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">outstanding film</span> from many points of view, including plot, cast and cinematography. It 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">has the audience completely captivated and questioning their own morals and thoughts</span>, which is what I believe a 
good and memorable movie should do - <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">get inside the mind of the audience, captivate them throughout the 
movie, keep them on the edge of their seat, but also leave them with something to think about after 
watching it</span>.
